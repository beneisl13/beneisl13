- 👋 Hi, I’m Ben
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to become a web developer. I'm not sure whether I want to do front end, back end, or full stack.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. I've heard that I should also take a look at FCC and The Odin Project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever will help me learn how to code properly. I am very new in the field and have never written code before so any help is appreciated.
